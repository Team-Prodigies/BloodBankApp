<h2>The Benefits of Donating Blood<h2>

Benefits
Donating blood has benefits for your emotional and physical health. According to a report by the Mental Health Foundation, helping others can:

- reduce stress
- improve your emotional well-being

Health benefits of donating blood
Prevents hemochromatosis  
Donating blood would reduce the risk of developing hemochromatosis. This health condition could be inherited at our cost due to alcoholism, anaemia and various other disorders.

Blood cell production
After a person donates blood, the body will replenish the blood loss by stimulating the production of new blood cells. The new blood cells would help in maintaining a person’s good health.  

Lowering cancer risk
Donating blood helps lower the risk of cancer as the iron stores in the blood are maintained at healthy levels. When there is a reduced iron level in the body, it is linked to lower cancer risk. At the same time, when the iron is too low in the body, it leads to iron deficiency and other related health conditions.

Heart and liver health
Donating blood is beneficial as it reduces the risk of heart and liver ailments which are caused due to iron overload in the body. When people consume excess food in the body, they only absorb limited proportions, and the rest of it gets stored in the heart, liver, or pancreas.  

Excess iron present in the body will increase the risk of developing health conditions like liver failure, pancreatic damage, or heart abnormalities.  

Therefore, by donating blood, the body can maintain the required levels of iron and reduce the risk of various health conditions.  

To sum up  
Donating blood is an excellent way to serve the community as both the donor and the receiver will reap health benefits.  

Blood donating processes are quick and easy.  

Usually, there are no side effects while donating blood. If a person is a frequent blood donor consulting a doctor about iron supplements and getting the blood level normal in the body is mandatory.

Other types of donation include:

platelet donation (plateletpheresis)
plasma donation (plasmapheresis)
double red cell donation
